				<h3>Steps</h3>
				<ol>
				
					<li>For the Hollandaise sauce, whisk the egg yolks, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper together in a stainless steel bowl. Place the bowl on top of a medium-sized saucepan containing lightly simmering water (or a double boiler,) the water should not touch the bottom of the bowl.</li>
					<li>Continue to whisk. Be careful not to let the eggs get too hot or they will scramble and separate. Add the melted butter, whisking constantly until the sauce is thickened and the volume has increased.</li>
					<li>Remove bowl from the heat, cover and set aside until ready to serve. If sauce gets too thick, whisk in a little warm water before serving.</li>
					<li>Fry the bacon in a medium skillet (or bake it) and toast the French bread directly on the oven rack under the broiler, about 5 minutes.</li>
					<li>Meanwhile, begin to poach eggs. Fill a large saucepan with 3-4 inches of water, bring to a simmer and add vinegar. Break each egg and carefully place in the water and cook for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and set aside (crack eggs into small prep bowls ahead of time for easy adding to the simmering water). There is no need to whirlpool the water.</li>
					<li>Butter each slice of french bread, top with a slice of halved bacon, 3 avocado slices, one poached egg, and drizzle with hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve immediately.</li>
